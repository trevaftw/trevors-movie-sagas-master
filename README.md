# Movie Time!

This app is designed to practice using React-Redux and Sagas. A user is able to click on a movie poster and get the genres of the movie and the details, and can click through to edit the information if it is incorrect and update the databse accordingly. 

## Database Setup

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database.
3. You will need to create the junction table between the `movies` and `genres` tables!

## Starting project locally

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm run client`

## Notes
 
### Movies
There are movie posters in the `public/images` folder, and the database is set up to use them.
